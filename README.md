## Two Week Project by Hunter Wallace and Bryson Ward
Our project is WikiSearcher. This program sorts the most recent revisors of a wikipedia webpage. The search is sorted by the most recent revision to the webpage. You can search any word and it will return the names of the most recent 25 names. This project was built using Java, JavaFX, and Maven.
